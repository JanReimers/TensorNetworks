-GUI
    Control panel
        Play/Pause in one button.  Use icons?
    Status bar. ModelName (from H), L,S, D, iter#, E, CPU & meminfo (use psutils)
-Fresh checkout and build.
-Ham->CreateMPS should be a /Factory/ so py knows to delete it.
-Convergence schedule,  increase D, drop epsilons
-Dynamically add lattice site, pseudo DMRG
-Done Separate out contraction code in MPSite
-Done Get rid of old dumm-ass contraction code.
-Done Simplify rescale step in normalization?
-Figure out why S=1,L>5 has such poor convergence. We may need to count degeneracy of lowest SVs.
    -For L=5 D=9 works, but that is the 2^L Hilbert space
    -For L=6 D=12 and D=27 works
    -For L=9 Hard to find a D that converges
Bugs:
    -log(DE) sopts plotting L=6 D=?
    -Bond Entropy missing points L=6 D=?
-Calc <Sx> <Sy> <Sz>
    Could start by calculating one density matrices.  Then ops are easy
-Correlation functions <Sa*Sa+n>-<Sa>*<Sa+n>
    Extend to pair density matricies.  It would interesting to see the eigen values of distant
    pair DMs.  Do the lowest two EVs drop with distance, indicating decrreasing entanglement?
-Calc 1&2 site density matrices
    Done Start a new theory doc.
    Done Get refs working from DOIs (give up on JabRef)
    Write out diagrams and iterative formulas for 2 site density matrix.
-Why optimize site 1, just leave it a |up> and take out global SU(2) invariance
    is this related to poor convergence for S>1/2 ??
-Why is dE~10e-15 for sites 1&2 on right sweep and sites L-1,L-2 on left sweep?
    is this related to poor convergence for S>1/2 ??
-Valgrind, any memeory leaks?
Done -Start a new cleaner lyx doc with tensor diagrams
    Done -Find a quite diagraming tool: LibreOfficeDraw seems to work.  However you can export whole pages
     as PNGs so one must then use ImageMagic to crop and separate the diagram.  Ho-hum



-Done Mega classes MPState MPSite are too big, how split up responsibilities?
    Move some stuff into bond objects
    Partially DONE.  Made more stuff private at least.
-Done Give Lanczos an initial guess from previous iteration.
-Done Speed up <E^2> contractions, take advantage of W shapes.  Make Dw2 a function of w1.
    Before Implementation:
        <E^2> contraction for L=10, S=2.5, D=4 took 10.6321 seconds.
        <E^2> contraction for L=10, S=0.5, D=16 took 28.8432 seconds.
    After implementation:
        <E^2> contraction for L=10, S=2.5, D=4 took 2.66917 seconds.
        <E^2> contraction for L=10, S=0.5, D=16 took 6.41037 seconds.
    Further reduced by return referneces in GetW calls
        <E^2> contraction for L=10, S=2.5, D=4 took 0.916441 seconds.
        <E^2> contraction for L=10, S=0.5, D=16 took 3.01753 seconds.
    Put gates in to check for the more zero elements in W
        <E^2> contraction for L=10, S=2.5, D=4 took 0.076742 seconds.
        <E^2> contraction for L=10, S=0.5, D=16 took 0.660434 seconds.

    Cleaned up the last few W(n,m) multiplictions and ranges.  Now this is the hot loop
    SparseMatrix<std::complex<double> >::DoMVMultiplication

-Done Give eigen solver a good starting wavevector.

-Imag time evolution
-Periodic boundary conditions.  This is less useful than iMPS
-iMPS, iDMRG
-GUI using wxPython
    -What to show in screen?
        Lattice
        Vectors (Sx,Sy,Sz) project to 2D.
        Colours
            Site energy
            Bond entropy
            Normalization A,B,M
Done    Live Graphs
            E vs iter#
            Sigma(E)  vs iter#
            Bond entropy vs site#
            <S^2> vs site#
            <E> vs site#
            Rank & D vs site#
            Heff degeneracy vs site # (might be harder with lowest eigen value solvers)



DONE -S>1/2 in Hamiltonian.  SPeed is irrelevant here.
DONE -Keep intermediates when iterating L&R tensors for Heff.
DONE -Iterate function with delta(E) convergence
DONE -  Improve with <H^2>-<H>^2 convergence, You need converge in D for this to go to zero.
DONE -Show sparsisity (# non zero elements) in H_eff for each site.
DONE -Profile, where are we spending the most time?
DONE -Start using sparse eigen solver.  Used the PRIMME system.
Done Separate norm status widgets for each site, update singles
E/J plot for each site doesn't really work since the y range gets so tiny
    Done Fix some plots, plot dE vs site# on log scale
    Done Plot points instead of lines
    Does wxDrivet support log scales?
    Done Rank vs. site#
    Done Fix axis code to avoid scientific unless ymin=0 or ymax=0
Control panel
    Done Get restart working(have restart do what start does now, get rid of start, play nad step will start it)
    Done On startup Step should start the run
    Done Stop shoud kill the thread
Done Split the classes into separate files wxMPSFrame.py is getting too big.
Done Create Bond objects between sites.  Each site can see its left and right bond objects.
Done Fix alignments on Ham tab
Done Use eps values.
