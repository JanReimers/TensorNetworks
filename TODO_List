-GUI
    Separate norm status widgets for each site, update singles
    E/J plot for each sote doesn't really work since the y range gets so tiny
    Play/Pause in one button.  Use icons?
    Get restart working
    Stop shoud kill the thread
    Split the classes into separate files wxMPSFrame.py is getting to big.
-Done Mega classes MPState MPSite are too big, how split up responsibilities?
    Partially DONE.  Made more stuff private at least.
-Calc <Sx> <Sy> <Sz>
-Correlation functions <Sa*Sa+n>-<Sa>*<Sa+n>
-Why optimize site 1, just leave it a |up> and take out global SU(2) invariance
-Valgrind, any memeory leaks?
-Give Lanczos an initial guess from previous iteration.
-Imag time evolution
-Periodic boundary conditions.  This is less usefule than iMPS
-iMPS, iDMRG
-GUI using wxPython
    -What to show in screen?
        Lattice
        Vectors (Sx,Sy,Sz) project to 2D.
        Colours
            Site energy
            Bond entropy
            Normalization A,B,M
Done    Live Graphs
            E vs iter#
            Sigma(E)  vs iter#
            Bond entropy vs site#
            <S^2> vs site#
            <E> vs site#
            Rank & D vs site#
            Heff degeneracy vs site # (might be harder with lowest eigen value solvers)



DONE -S>1/2 in Hamiltonian.  SPeed is irrelevant here.
DONE -Keep intermediates when iterating L&R tensors for Heff.
DONE -Iterate function with delta(E) convergence
DONE -  Improve with <H^2>-<H>^2 convergence, You need converge in D for this to go to zero.
DONE -Show sparsisity (# non zero elements) in H_eff for each site.
DONE -Profile, where are we spending the most time?
DONE -Start using sparse eigen solver.  Used the PRIMME system.
